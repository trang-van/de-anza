Store data of one team in variable:

NBA_Team object;

//Assigning member to struct object
object.name = "Boston Celtics";
object.conference = "Eastern";		//Don't need to store "conference" or "division"
object.division = "Atlantic";
object.wins = object.losses = 0;	//Count wins and losses
object.pct = 0;				//Percent won out of all games

//Write loop to read into all 30 teams
